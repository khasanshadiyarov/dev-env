# Development Environment
This is my personal pre-configured development environment, which is based on [Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) text editor.

## Installation
To install the development environment follow next steps:
1. Clone this repository to ~/.config/ as `micro`
```
cd ~/.config/

git clone https://github.com/khasanshadiyarov/dev-env.git micro
```
2. Run curl to install the micro in the same directory
```curl
curl https://getmic.ro | bash
```
That's it, now you are ready to use the development environment by executing the Micro in your terminal.

## Usage
To make it more convenient to use you can make move the Micro executable to `/usr/local/bin` or make an alias to the executable location, in our case it's `~/.config/micro/`.
